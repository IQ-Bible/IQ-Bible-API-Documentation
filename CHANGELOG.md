# Changelog

**IQ Bible API Official Documentation**  
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), with a clarification:

- **MAJOR.MINOR** versions (e.g., `1.38`) track the corresponding IQ Bible API version this documentation is aligned with.
- **PATCH** version (e.g., `1.38.2`) reflects changes to the documentation only â€” not the API itself.

This allows the docs to evolve while clearly indicating which version of the API they describe.
